# D5-Code
This project is part of our ELEC2217, D5 Smart Meter project. The algorithm was written by Joseph Butterworth which I then ported onto the Il Matto AVR development board. Our final test scored 80% which was the highest in the cohort.

The algorithm and surrounding testbench can be found in the folder [evaluator](https://github.com/jamesstocktonj1/D5-Code/tree/main/evaluator). The Il Matto files can be found in main.c.
